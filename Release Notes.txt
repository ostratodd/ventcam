Deep Stereo UCSB - Release Notes
================================

Date: 2025-02-26
Location: /749 Deep Stereo UCSB/2025-02-26.

Summary
-------
This release is intended to allow Deep Stereo to access the Sony IMX462's
low light capability.

ds.conf can now be used to set the following camera parameters:

* AutoExposure (CAP_PROP_AUTO_EXPOSURE) - turn camera's auto-exposure ON/OFF

* Backlight    (CAP_PROP_BACKLIGHT)     - switch camera mode between NORMAL
                                          MODE and ULTA LOW LIGHT MODE

* Exposure     (CAP_PROP_EXPOSURE)      - set exposure time

Comments are included in ds.conf to guide a user how to set the values. Checks
on AutoExposure and Exposure present in the 2025-02-25 release have been
removed to allow for a greater range of values to be passed to various camera
drivers.

Files
-----
There are two files in the folder:

* StereoCapture.py - Read AutoExposure and Exposure settings from ds.conf
                     and apply the settings to the cameras.

* ds.conf          - Add AutoExposure and Exposure settings.
